## 18.3 Introduction to URDF Models

<p id ="anther18.3.1"></p>

### 18.3.1 Overview and Basics of URDF Models

> [!NOTE]
> 
> **This section is based on configuration and simulation within a virtual machine. If the virtual machine is not yet installed, please first refer to section [18.1 Virtual Machine Installation and Import](#anther18.1) to complete the installation.**

* **URDF Model Introduction**

URDF is a format based on the XML specification, designed for describing the structure of robots. Its purpose is to provide a robot description standard that is as general and widely applicable as possible.

Robots are typically composed of multiple links and joints. A link is defined as a rigid object with certain physical properties, while a joint connects two links and constrains their relative motion.

By connecting links with joints and imposing motion restrictions, a kinematic model is formed. The URDF file specifies the relationships between joints and links, their inertial properties, geometric characteristics, and collision models.

* **Comparison between Xacro and URDF Model**

The URDF model serves as a description file for simple robot models, offering a clear and easily understandable structure. However, when it comes to describing complex robot structures, using URDF alone can result in lengthy and unclear descriptions.

To address this limitation, the xacro model extends the capabilities of URDF while maintaining its core features. The Xacro format provides a more advanced approach to describing robot structures. It greatly improves code reusability and helps avoid excessive description length.

For instance, when describing the two legs of a humanoid robot, the URDF model would require separate descriptions for each leg. On the other hand, the Xacro model allows for describing a single leg and reusing that description for the other leg, resulting in a more concise and efficient representation.

* **Install URDF Dependency**

> [!NOTE]
> 
> **The URDF and Xacro models are already installed in the virtual machine, so there is no need to reinstall them. This section is provided for reference only.**

1. Run the following command and press **Enter** to update the package information:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image1.png" style="width:600px" />

2. Run the following command and press **Enter** to install the URDF dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-urdf
```

When the output matches the image below, the installation is successful:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image3.png" style="width:600px" />

3. Run the following command and press **Enter** to install the Xacro model extension for URDF:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-xacro
```

When the output matches the image below, the installation is successful:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image5.png" style="width:600px" />

* **URDF Model Basic Syntax**

1. XML Basic Syntax

Since URDF models are written based on the XML specification, it is necessary to understand the basic structure of the XML format.

(1) An element can be defined as desired using the following formula:

**\<Element>**

**\</Element>**

(2) Attributes are contained within an element and are used to define certain properties and parameters of that element. When defining an element, the following format can be used:

**\<Element attribute_1="value1" attribute_2="value2">**

**\</Element>**

(3) Comments do not affect other attributes or elements. The following syntax can be used to define a comment:

<**！ \-- Comment content \-->**

2. Link

The Link element describes the visual and physical properties of the robot's rigid component. The following tags are commonly used to define the motion of a link:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image6.png" />

\<visual>: Describe the appearance of the link, such as size, color, and shape.

\<inertial>: Describe the inertia parameters of the link, which will be used in the dynamics calculation.

\<collision>: Defines the collision properties of the link.

Each tag contains its own child elements and serves different purposes. Refer to the table below for details.

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th style>Tag</th>
    <th style>Function</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>origin</td>
    <td>Describes the pose of the link. xyz defines the link’s position in the simulation map, and rpy defines its orientation in the simulation map.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mass</td>
    <td>Describes the mass of the link.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>inertia</td>
    <td>Describes the inertia of the link. Due to the symmetry of the inertia matrix, six parameters ixx, ixy, ixz, iyy, iyz, izz must be provided as attributes. These values need to be calculated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>geometry</td>
    <td>Describes the shape of the link. The mesh parameter loads the texture file, and the filename parameter loads the texture path. It includes three child tags: box, cylinder, sphere, used for rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical shapes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>material</td>
    <td>Describes the material of the link. The name parameter is required. The color child tag adjusts color and transparency.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

3. Joint

In a URDF model, a joint is represented by the \<joint> tag. It describes the kinematic and dynamic properties of the robot joint, including motion type, as well as position and velocity limits. According to the type of motion, joints in a URDF model can be categorized into six types:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Type & Description</th>
    <th>Label</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rotational joint: can rotate infinitely around a single axis</td>
    <td>continuous</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rotational joint: similar to continuous, but with rotation angle limits</td>
    <td>revolute</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prismatic joint: moves along an axis with position limits</td>
    <td>prismatic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Planar joint: allows translation or rotation in orthogonal plane directions</td>
    <td>planar</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Floating joint: allows both translation and rotation</td>
    <td>floating</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fixed joint: a special joint that does not allow movement</td>
    <td>fixed</td>
  </tr>
</table>


When defining joint behavior, the following tags are commonly used:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image7.png" />

\<parent_link>: Specifies the parent link.

\<child_link>: Specifies the child link.

\<calibration>: Used to calibrate the joint angle.

\<dynamics>: Describes certain physical properties of the motion.

\<limit>: Defines motion constraints.

Each tag contains its own child elements and serves different purposes. Refer to the table below for details.

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Label</th>
    <th>Function</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>origin</td>
    <td>Describes the pose of the parent link. It contains two parameters: xyz specifies the link's position in the simulation map, and rpy specifies the link's orientation in the simulation map.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>axis</td>
    <td>Sets the child link to rotate around any of the XYZ axes relative to the parent link.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>limit</td>
    <td>Restricts the child link. The lower and upper attributes define the rotation range in radians, the effort attribute limits the force during rotation with a positive or negative value, in Newtons or N, and the velocity attribute limits the rotational speed in meters per second or m/s.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mimic</td>
    <td>Describes the relationship of this joint with other joints.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>safety_controller</td>
    <td>Defines safety control parameters to protect the robot's joint movement.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


4. robot Tag

The top-level tag of a complete robot is \<robot>. All \<link> and \<joint> tags must be included within \<robot>, as shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image8.png" />

5. Gazebo Tag

Used with the Gazebo simulator, this tag allows configuration of simulation parameters, including Gazebo plugins and physical property settings.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image9.png" />

6. Creating a Simple URDF Model

(1) Set the Robot Model Name

At the beginning of the URDF model, set the robot’s name using: **\<robot name="Robot_Model_Name">** At the end of the model, enter **\</robot>** to indicate that the robot model definition is complete.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image10.png" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image11.png" />

(2) Define Links

① To write the first link and use indentation to indicate that it is part of the currently set model. Set the name of the link using the following format: **\<link name="Link_Name">**. At the end of the link definition, enter **\</link>** to indicate that the link definition is complete.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image12.png" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image13.png" />

② When writing the link description, use indentation to indicate that the description belongs to the current link. Start the description with **\<visual>** and end it with **\</visual>**.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image14.png" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image15.png" />

③ The **\<geometry>** tag is employed to define the shape of a link. Once the description is complete, end it with **\</geometry>**. Within the **\<geometry>** tag, indentation is used to specify the detailed description of the link's shape. The code below shows the shape of a link: **\<cylinder&nbsp;length=“0.01”&nbsp;radius=“0.2”/>**. Here, length="0.01" indicates that the link is 0.01 meters long, and radius="0.2" indicates that the link has a radius of 0.2 meters, forming a cylinder.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image16.png" />

④ The **\<origin>** tag is utilized to specify the position of a link, with indentation used to indicate the detailed description of the link's position. The following example demonstrates the position of a link: **\<origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0" />**. In this example, rpy represents the angles of the link, while xyz represents the coordinates of the link's position. This example places the link at the origin of the coordinate system.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image17.png" />

⑤ The **\<material>** tag is used to define the visual appearance of a link, with indentation used to specify the detailed description of the link's color. To start describing the color, include **\<material>**, and end with **\</material>** when the description is complete. The following example demonstrates setting a link color to yellow: **\<color rgba="1 1 0 1" />**. In this example, rgba="1 1 0 1" represents the color threshold for achieving a yellow color.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image18.png" />

(3) Define Joints

① To define the first joint, use indentation to indicate that the joint belongs to the current model being set. Then, specify the name and type of the joint as follows: **\<joint name="Joint_Name" type="Joint_Type">**. At the end of the joint definition, enter **\</joint>** to indicate that the joint definition is complete.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image19.png" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image20.png" />

② Define the parent and child links of the joint. Indent the contents to show that this description belongs to the current joint. Set the parent and child parameters as follows: Format: **\<parent link="Parent_Link"/>

\<child link="Child_Link"/>** When the joint rotates, the parent link serves as the pivot, and the child link rotates relative to it.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image21.png" />

③ **\<origin>** describes the position of the joint, with indentation used to specify the detailed coordinates of the joint. The code below describes the position of the joint: **\<origin xyz=“0 0 0.1” />**. Here, xyz specifies the coordinates of the joint, placing it at x=0, y=0, z=0.1 in the coordinate system.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image22.png" />

④ **\<axis>** specifies the joint’s orientation. Indent its contents to define the joint’s axis and rotation direction. The code below shows a joint’s orientation: **\<axis&nbsp;xyz=“0&nbsp;0&nbsp;1”&nbsp;/>**. Here, xyz specifies the orientation of the joint.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image23.png" />

⑤ **\<limit>** defines motion constraints for the joint. Indent its contents to provide detailed limits on the joint’s angle. The code below shows a joint whose maximum torque does not exceed 300 N, with an upper rotation limit of 3.14 radians and a lower limit of -3.14 radians. These limits are defined according to the following formula: effort = joint torque (N), velocity = joint movement speed, lower = lower rotation limit (rad), upper = upper rotation limit (rad).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image24.png" />

⑥ **\<dynamics>** describes the joint’s dynamics, with indentation used to define the joint’s dynamic properties. The code below shows an example of a joint’s dynamics parameters: **\<dynamics damping="50" friction="1" />**, where damping specifies the damping value, and friction specifies the friction coefficient.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image25.png" />

The complete code is as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_3/media/image26.png" />

### 18.4.4 Gazebo Mapping Simulation

* **Configuration**

> [!NOTE]
> 
> **Commands must be entered with correct capitalization. The Tab key can be used to auto-complete keywords.**

When mapping is required in an ideal environment that cannot be replicated in the real world, the desired scenario can be created in Gazebo for mapping simulation.

1) On the virtual machine, click the desktop icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image2.png"  /> to open a terminal.

2. Enter the command to launch the Gazebo simulation.

```
ros2 launch robot_gazebo room_worlds.launch.py
```

3) Click the icon <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image2.png"  /> to open a new terminal and enter the following command to start the mapping service.

```
ros2 launch robot_gazebo slam.launch.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image19.png" style="width:600px" />

* **Mapping Operation**

1) Enter the following command to enable keyboard-controlled mapping:

```
ros2 run robot_gazebo teleop_key_control
```

Once the following window appears, click anywhere inside the window with the mouse to start controlling. The specific key functions are listed in the table below:

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Function</th>
      <th>Operation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>W</td>
      <td>Robot moves forward</td>
      <td>Tap</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S</td>
      <td>Robot moves backward</td>
      <td>Tap</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>Turn left</td>
      <td>Hold</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>Turn right</td>
      <td>Hold</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

2)  Control the robot to explore and build the simulation map. The mapping progress will be displayed simultaneously in RViz, as shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image21.png" style="width:600px" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image22.png" style="width:600px" />

Scan the map until it roughly reaches the state shown below.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image23.png" style="width:600px" />

3) Enter the command to navigate to the directory where maps are stored and save the map.

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/robot_gazebo/maps && ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f "map_01" --ros-args -p map_subscribe_transient_local:=true
```

In this command, **map_01** is the map name, which can be renamed as needed. If the following prompt appears, it means the map has been saved successfully.

> **Commands must be entered with correct capitalization. The Tab key can be used to auto-complete keywords.**

1) Launch the virtual machine. Click the terminal icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image2.png"  /> in the system desktop to open a command-line window.

2. Enter the following command to launch the simulation map:

```bash
ros2 launch robot_gazebo room_worlds.launch.py nav:=true
```

3) Click the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image2.png"  /> to open a new terminal.

4) Enter the following command to load the map for navigation and start the navigation process:

```bash
ros2 launch robot_gazebo navigation.launch.py map:=map_01
```

The **map_01** at the end of the command is the map name and can be modified as needed. The map is stored at the directory of **/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/robot_gazebo/maps**.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image27.png" style="width:600px" />

* **Starting Navigation**

The software menu bar contains three tools: 2D Pose Estimate, 2D Nav Goal, and Publish Point.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image28.png"  />

**2D Pose Estimate**: Used to set the robot’s initial position. **2D Nav Goal**: Used to set a single target point for the robot. **Publish Point**: Used to set multiple target points for the robot.

1\. Click the **2D Nav Goal** tool in the software menu, then click a location on the map to set it as the target point. By pressing and dragging the mouse, the robot’s orientation upon reaching the target point can also be specified. The robot will automatically generate a path and move to the target point.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_18/section_4/media/image29.png"  />

2\. Once the target point is set, the map will display the planned path, and the robot’s simulation model will move to the corresponding position.
